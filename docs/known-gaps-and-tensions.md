# Known Gaps & Tensions (Great Simplification)

## Current Gaps
- **Rolling summary is optional** and may be undefined in some sessions.
- **Synapse briefs are narrative** and may omit fine‑grained facts.
- **Query‑aware briefs are not enabled** for `/session/brief` yet.

## Tensions
- Tight prompts vs. rich memory detail
- Session‑level ingestion vs. per‑turn extraction

## What We Are Not Solving Yet
- Cross‑session caching of Synapse results
- Tool orchestration and branching flows
- Automated memory conflict resolution on the app side
